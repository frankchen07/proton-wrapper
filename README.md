# protonmail gmail shortcuts wrapper

is protonmail ever going to fix their shortcuts issue and make it standard like gmail?

probably not, so i just vibecoded a wrapper to do it myself

installation instructions:

1. use brave browser
2. get the violentmonkey extension
`https://violentmonkey.github.io/` and
`https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag`
3. create a new script in the extension, name it whatever you want
4. copy the code from `.user.js` in this repo over to the script in the extension
5. hit save
6. refresh your protonmail window
7. j, k, x, shift 3, shift i, shift u, l, standard gmail shortcuts to make your day

enjoy

if there's bugs, sorry, comment or make a pull request and i'll look at it
